#Read me

#This folder contains files that I used to clean data and create variables for my online experimentation project

#It contains a couple of R scripts that do some of the data cleaning
#This overall project was done using a combination of SQL (data warehouse extraction), python (data extraction from back end and api and organization), R, and stata (for random effect models)
